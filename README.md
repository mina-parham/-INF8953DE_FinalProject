In this paper, the authors tried to propose a regularization framework for least-square temporal differences learning. Specifically, they presented an approach to find the fixed point by using l1 regularization framework. To evaluate the framework’s efficiency, they examined the framework by using two well-known problems, which means Mountain Car and Chain Domain. The results showed that the framework could deal with challenges well
